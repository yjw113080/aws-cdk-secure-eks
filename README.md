# Manage your EKS Cluster in Full-stack with AWS CDK
In this repository, you will find how CDK could help you to manage EKS in AWS Well-Architected ways. Let's find out what AWS Well-Architected Framework is and, how CDK works with EKS by each pillars of the framework.

## AWS Well Architected Framework
AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications and workloads. Based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization — AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that can scale over time.

It defines the criteria to determin whether an architecture is designed well by the following five pillars.

1. Operational Excellence Pillar: it focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.
2. Security Pillar, focusing on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, identifying and managing who can do what with privilege management, protecting systems, and establishing controls to detect security events.
3. Reliability Pillar ensures a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. A resilient workload quickly recovers from failures to meet business and customer demand. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and how to handle change.
4. Performance Efficiency Pillar focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently. Key topics include selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve
5. Cost Optimization Pillar aims to avoid unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding and controlling where money is being spent, selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types, analyzing spend over time, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.
